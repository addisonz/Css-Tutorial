    <h2>Summary of Article</h2>

    <p>
        I learned in the article that you can use SVG for icons, which is supported by all modern browsers and all resoulution types.You can change the way tables are rendered with fixed table layouts, which gives you a sturdier and more predictable layout. The CSS property shape-outside allows geometric shapes to be set, to define an area for text to flow around, which will curve text around a floated image. Intrinsic ratio boxes are used with 20% padding that makes the height of the box equal to 20% of its width. A very easy way to make your elements look better is by using color fade on hover. There is a way to style broken images and provide custom error messages to visitors by using some advanced CSS. There is a way in CSS3 to apply different styles to an element whether an attribute is empty of not. There is a way to display an unordered list as comma-separated, using :not(:last-child) so the last element will not be separated by a comma.
